#Solo Traveler App

A web app that helps the user to gain necessary information regarding the destination they wish to travel such as, criminal data of the area and weather forcast of the area on the date they wish to travel.
Using this information, the user can take necessary decisions about his travel.

Implemented in Visual studio using C# and concepts of distributed software development.
Developed and deployed my own RESTful and WSDL webservices and used the same in the app.
